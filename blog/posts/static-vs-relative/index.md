Recently I have been dedicating some time to the study of the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. A couple of days ago I wrote a blog post on [my very first Front-End Kata](/post/13).

I decided to add a couple of follow up articles to share a few things I learned through this experience.<!--end--> It isn't mean to teach the basics of CSS, just meant to share 2 or 3 interesting pieces of info I remembered the most ðŸ™‚. Today is the second article of the mini-series.

### CSS `position`: `static` vs `relative`

The general concept of positioning different elements on a page with CSS is a vast topic, and not the subject of this article. Even the attribute `position` alone has 7 different possible values. Today I'd like to simply focus on the difference between `position: static` and `position: relative`.

Without any styling, HTML elements will be placed below one another _(not true for [`inline` elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements))_, this is called the [Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout).<D-r>

By default the `position` CSS property has for value: `static`.

* In `static` positioning, the HTML element follows the **Normal Flow** of the page.
* In `relative` positioning, the HTML element _also_ follows the **Normal Flow** of the page.

So, what is the difference?  

##### Allows offsetting
The first difference between `static` and `relative` is that `relative` allows **offsetting**. By default, the CSS properties `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` have **no effect** on the HTML element. They are simply ignored.

Setting `position: relative`, allow these attributes to now have an effect. And this is probably where the name _relative_ comes from: `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` now act as an offset relative to the position the element would have following the **Natural Flow**.

##### Acts as an Anchor for `absolute` positioned children

One other way to position an element is to have it `position: absolute`. With this option, the HTML element will **NOT** follow the **Natural Flow** and instead will be positioned at the absolute coordinates given by `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right`.

And now comes the tricky and frankly counter-intuitive part, for me at least. By default, `position: static`, elements will **NOT** act as an **Anchor** for child elements. In other words, with that structure:

```html
<div class="parent">
    <div class="child"></div>
</div>
```
```css
.parent {
    /* By default */
    position: static;

    width: 400px;
    height: 400px;
}
.child {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 25px;

    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
}
```

`.child` will **NOT** be positioned `25px` from the bottom of `.parent`. It will be positioned `25px` from the bottom of the very ROOT document, at the end of the page. In CSS jargon we would say the element `.parent` is **not "positioned"**

To make the `.parent` act as and **Anchor** for the `.child`, simply changing `position` to `relative` will do the trick. Since we haven't specified `bottom`, `top`, `left` or `right` values in the `.parent`, its position will not change when switching from `position: static` to `position: relative`, see [above](#allows-offsetting). But it will now **act as an Anchor**. And, finally, `.child` will be positioned `25px` from the bottom of `.parent`. In CSS jargon we would say the element `.parent` is now **"positioned"**

_See the proof, and experiment for yourself: [Codepen - Acting as an Anchor for child elements](https://codepen.io/FlorianKempenich/pen/WqMOoK)_


And that's it for today, I hope it was helpful ðŸ˜ƒ
